1. host machine wants to interact with an app running inside a docker container
	-p 3000:3001

2. app running inside a docker container wants to interact with a service running in the host machine
	instead of machine name (in order to access the service running in the host machine) use this DNS name: host.docker.internal

3. app running inside a docker container wants to send request to www
	no extra configuration required, as containerized apps can simply send request to WWW.

4. app running inside a docker container wants to interact with another app running inside another docker container
	1. using IP adsress of the container
	docker always creates an IP address for every container that is managing.
	you can use the IP address of any container to get connected to (to send request to) from another container

	2. using DNS name of the container
	docker provides network driver (bridge) for interacion between the containers (also provides a default network too)
	you can create a new network under bridge driver and connect the containers with it using --network flag
	the network will provide DNS name for each container to interact with.

network drivers: 
	host (also the network named, host)
	bridge (also the network named, bridge)
	none (complete isolation)
	ipvlan
	maclan
